## MediaPipe & OpenCV

In this project I was able to work closely with OpenCV and mediapipe models. The goal was to create a system that shows on the feed the full body detections. Models such as face, hands and pose were used within the detection cam. 


### Dependencies

* Python 3.10
* CVzone (https://github.com/cvzone/cvzone)
* MediaPipe (https://google.github.io/mediapipe/solutions/face_mesh)
